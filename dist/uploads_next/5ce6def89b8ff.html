                <!-- <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2> -->
                <p>It all began 10 years ago, when on a hot sultry afternoon, I was taken by the bewitching effects of fruit, squeezed into pure perfection. It was an unparallel antidote to the fatigue that results from the unforgiving climate of our country. At Mania, we want to chase the feeling of flavorful fruit juices washing, hydrating & enriching every parched emotion of our mind, body, and soul. We pursue that experience to last every day.
